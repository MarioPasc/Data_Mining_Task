This GitHub repository contains all the code for a comprehensive tutorial on data mining algorithms, specifically focusing on Naive Bayes, ID3, and k-means algorithms. The tutorial aims to provide a step-by-step explanation of each algorithm's mechanics, complete with code samples and relevant calculations.

These resources are intended for a potential classroom presentation as part of the 'Intelligent Systems' course in a bioinformatics degree program.
